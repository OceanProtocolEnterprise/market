title: Cookie Policy
description: This cookie policy explains how Ocean Protocol Enterprise uses cookies and similar technologies on our website.

A cookie is a small file that stores Internet settings. Almost every website uses cookie technology. It is downloaded by your web browser on the first visit to a website. The next time this website is opened with the same user device, the cookie and the information stored in it is either sent back to the website that created it (first-party cookie) or sent to another website it belongs to (third-party cookie). This enables the website to detect that you have opened it previously with this browser and in some cases to vary the displayed content.

When you first arrive on our site, a cookie banner will be shown. By accepting the cookies, you help us to provide better content in the future. The only downside for rejecting cookies on your side is that you will not be able to see some content loaded from external sources, which at the moment is only Twitter content.

The collected IP addresses are truncated before being sent to Google, making them anonymized. Google Analytics also sets cookies.

On our site, only Google Analytics and Twitter set cookies. We have to set a cookie of our own though, for remembering your acceptance or rejection of our cookie banner. This cookie will stay in your browser for 13 months, unless you delete it manually. This is so we can detect your acceptance or rejection on your next visit, and adapt the site accordingly.

If you have Do Not Track activated in your browser, or if you rejected our cookie banner, we won’t let Google set any cookies in your browser.

## Contact & Data Controller

You also have the option of disabling cookies in your browser setting, and deleting cookies from your computer’s hard disk at any time.

If you want to change your cookie consent, click the **Cookie Settings** link at the bottom of the page.

In general, you can block cookies by using your browser’s settings, or by installing a browser add-on such as:

- [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/)
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)

## Google Analytics

The site uses Google Analytics, which provides us with anonymized information about our users (such as anonymized IP address, browser version, and so on) and how they use the site. We use this information to make the site better.

If you hit **Reject** on the cookie banner, all previously set Google cookies will be deleted, and the rejection is stored in a cookie named `CookieConsent` with a value of `false`.
